    "## Fjord Vanlife: Campervan Rental in Stavanger\n",
    "\n",
    "Traveling in a campervan is an excellent way to explore nature, outdoor activities, and attractions in the local area. Tourists visiting the Stavanger region often want to experience nature attractions outside the city. A van containing the necessary equipment and furniture for overnight stays can be a good and less expensive option for tourists. However, there are currently no established rental companies for campervans in the nearby area."

    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze the commercial viability of a campervan rental company in the Stavanger area. The focus will be on determining if such a business can be profitable and, if so, what would be the optimal investment capital for a successful start-up. This decision context requires a comprehensive analysis of market conditions, financial projections, and risk assessment, making it suitable for applying decision analysis processes and modeling techniques."
