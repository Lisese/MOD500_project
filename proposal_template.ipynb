    "## Should We Start a Campervan Rental Business in Stavanger?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traveling in a campervan is an excellent way to explore nature, outdoor activities, and attractions in the local area. Tourists visiting the Stavanger region often want to experience nature attractions outside the city. A van containing the necessary equipment and furniture for overnight stays can be a good and less expensive option for tourists. However, there are currently no established rental companies for campervans in the nearby area.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze the commercial viability of a campervan rental company in the Stavanger area. The focus will be on determining if such a business can be profitable and, if so, what would be the optimal investment capital for a successful start-up. This decision context requires a comprehensive analysis of market conditions, financial projections, and risk assessment, making it suitable for applying decision analysis processes and modeling techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Maximize Profitability: Assess the potential for profit in the campervan rental business, using Net Present Value (NPV) as the primary measure. NPV will be calculated over a 5-year period, considering initial investment, projected revenues, and operational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Maximize Customer Satisfaction: Develop a metric to measure and maximize customer satisfaction, which could include factors such as comfort, convenience, and overall experience. This will be measured on a scale of 1-10 based on customer surveys and reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Maximize Market Share: Aim to capture the largest possible share of the tourist market in the Stavanger area. This will be measured as a percentage of total tourists using our campervan rental service.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Optimize Operational Efficiency: Streamline operations to minimize costs and maximize resource utilization. This will be measured by the ratio of operational costs to revenue.\n",
    "\n",
